### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About me

I'm Dave Hay and I am in the process of changing career from Chemical Engineering to Data Science. I have a BEng in Chemical Engineering and an MSc in Process Technology and Management. I have been interested in CS and problem solving but have not pursued it as a career until now.

#### My Current Work

Iâ€™m currently learning Python and developing my coding and data science skills with the help of a CoGrammar bootcamp and multiple Udemy courses.

#### My Projects
[A webcam monitoring and email app](https://github.com/CriticallyDave/webcam-monitoring-email)
[A decimal to binary palindrome checker](https://github.com/CriticallyDave/dec-to-bin-palindrome)
